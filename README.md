# Olympic Analysis

## Key factors that influence a country’s or an athlete’s success in the Olympic Games.

## Hypothesis
How Population, age, and GDP affect athletes' performance.

## Approach
1.	Analyze the distribution of medals by athlete, sport, and country to identify trends in Olympic success.
2.	Compare athlete performance based on key factors such as age, gender, nationality, and experience to determine their impact on success.
3.	Examine the correlation between a country’s GDP, population size, and medal count to explore broader national influences on Olympic performance.
4.	Identify key patterns that contribute to Olympic success, providing insights into the factors that drive strong performances at the Games.

## Datasets
1.	Olympic Summer & Winter Games, 1896-2022 : [3 most recent winter/summer olympics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/olympic-games-medals-19862018)
2.	GDP by Country : [GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd)
3.	Population, total : [Population](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

## Expected Outcome
By leveraging historical Olympic data, we will explore patterns and trends that contribute to medal-winning performances. Our findings could be used to optimize athlete training programs, national sports policies, and investment strategies for future Olympic participation.
